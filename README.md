# About me 👋

I am a quantum physics PhD, mainly specialised in numerical simulation and package development. You can find my PhD thesis [in this link](https://theses.hal.science/tel-05383369).

The subject of my PhD was _Quantum machine learning with bosonic modes_. During my PhD, I developped a PyTorch package allowing to efficiently simulate the dynamics of coupled gaussian bosonic modes with backpropagation, for gradient descent optimization. You can find a simplified and overhauled version of it on my personal repository _gausstorch_.

The purpose of the _gausstorch_ package is to provide a scalable and well-documented framework for gaussian mode simulation with PyTorch, for future PhD students in the field.
 
- 🔭 I’m currently looking for work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on R&D projects in general. If the physics and software development is interesting, I'm interested.
- 💬 If you have any questions about my PhD work or the _gausstorch_ package, feel free to contact me.
